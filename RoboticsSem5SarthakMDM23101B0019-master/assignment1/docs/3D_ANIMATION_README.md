# 3D Robotic Arm Animation with PyBullet

## Overview

This project now includes a **3D robotic arm animation** using PyBullet physics simulation, featuring a JCB-style excavator arm with realistic 3D visualization and physics-based animation.

## Features

### 3D Robotic Arm Simulation
- **Realistic JCB-style design**: Multi-segment arm resembling construction equipment
- **4-DOF control**: Four controllable joints (3 revolute + 1 revolute for bucket)
- **Physics simulation**: Realistic physics with gravity and collision detection
- **Smooth animation**: Interpolated motion between keyframes
- **Interactive 3D visualization**: Real-time 3D graphics with camera controls

### Animation Capabilities
- **Digging sequence**: Automated digging motion like real excavators
- **Joint control**: Individual control of each joint
- **Smooth interpolation**: Smooth motion between poses
- **Real-time physics**: Gravity and collision simulation
- **Camera system**: Optimized camera angles for viewing

## Installation

The 3D animation requires PyBullet in addition to the existing dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Requirements include:
- PyBullet >= 3.2.0 (for 3D physics simulation)
- NumPy >= 1.21.0
- Matplotlib >= 3.5.0
- SciPy >= 1.7.0

## Usage

### Method 1: Through Main Menu

```bash
python main.py
```

Select option `3. 3D Robotic Arm Animation (PyBullet)` from the menu.

### Method 2: Direct Execution

```bash
python pybullet_arm_animation.py
```

### Method 3: Programmatic Usage

```python
from pybullet_arm_animation import PyBulletRoboticArm

# Create 3D robotic arm
arm = PyBulletRoboticArm(gui=True)

# Set joint positions
arm.set_joint_positions([0.5, -0.8, 1.2, 0.3])

# Run digging animation
arm.animate_digging_sequence(duration=10.0)

# Get end effector position
position = arm.get_end_effector_position()
print(f"End effector at: {position}")

# Cleanup
arm.cleanup()
```

## Technical Details

### Robot Configuration
- **Base**: Cylindrical base (yellow, like JCB branding)
- **Boom**: Main arm segment (2.5m length)
- **Stick**: Secondary arm segment (2.0m length)
- **Bucket**: End effector with rotation capability
- **Total reach**: Approximately 5.5 meters

### Joint Configuration
1. **Joint 1**: Base rotation (revolute, ±180°)
2. **Joint 2**: Boom elevation (revolute, ±90°)
3. **Joint 3**: Stick extension (revolute, full range)
4. **Joint 4**: Bucket rotation (revolute, ±180°)

### Animation Sequences
The system includes pre-programmed animation sequences:

1. **Initial Position**: Extended forward reach
2. **Reach Down**: Lower to digging position
3. **Dig**: Penetrate into ground
4. **Lift**: Lift with material
5. **Swing**: Rotate to dump position
6. **Dump**: Release material
7. **Return**: Back to initial position

## Testing

Test the 3D animation functionality:

```bash
python test_3d_animation.py
```

This runs headless tests to verify:
- Joint control functionality
- End effector positioning
- Animation sequencing
- PyBullet integration
